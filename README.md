# Power-Systems

A power system, also known as an electrical grid, is a network of interconnected components used to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity to consumers. It consists of power generation plants, such as thermal, hydro, nuclear, or renewable energy sources, which produce electricity. The generated power is then transmitted over long distances through high-voltage transmission lines to substations. At the substations, the voltage is stepped down for local distribution, and the electricity is delivered to homes, businesses, and industries through lower-voltage distribution lines. 

Power systems play a vital role in supplying electricity to meet the energy needs of societies, enabling the functioning of various appliances, machines, and technologies we rely on in our daily lives.

## 1. Y<sub>bus</sub> Matrix Computation

Y<sub>bus</sub>, also known as the admittance matrix or bus admittance matrix, is a fundamental component of power system analysis. It represents the electrical network's impedance and conductance values in a matrix form.

In simple terms, Ybus summarizes the interconnectedness of different components in a power system, such as generators, transformers, transmission lines, and loads. It is used to analyze the flow of electricity, voltage levels, and power losses within the network. By calculating the Ybus matrix, we can determine parameters like voltage stability, fault analysis, and optimal power flow in the system.

## 2. Gauss Seidel Load Flow Analysis

Gauss-Seidel Load Flow Analysis is a computational method used in power system analysis to calculate the steady-state voltages and power flows in an electrical network. It is an iterative technique that helps determine the voltage magnitude and angle at each bus (node) in the system.

In simple terms, the Gauss-Seidel Load Flow Analysis starts with an initial estimate of voltages at all buses. It then iteratively updates the voltage values at each bus based on the power flow equations until the solution converges to a stable state. This process is repeated until the calculated voltages satisfy the power flow equations within a certain tolerance.
