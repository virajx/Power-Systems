# Power-Systems

A power system, also known as an electrical grid, is a network of interconnected components used to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity to consumers. It consists of power generation plants, such as thermal, hydro, nuclear, or renewable energy sources, which produce electricity. The generated power is then transmitted over long distances through high-voltage transmission lines to substations. At the substations, the voltage is stepped down for local distribution, and the electricity is delivered to homes, businesses, and industries through lower-voltage distribution lines. 

Power systems play a vital role in supplying electricity to meet the energy needs of societies, enabling the functioning of various appliances, machines, and technologies we rely on in our daily lives.
